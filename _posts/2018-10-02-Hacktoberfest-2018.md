DigitalOcean is sponsoring Hacktoberfest for the fifth year in a row. The first 50,000 people to make 5 pull requests in the month of October receive a free t-shirt!

### Encouraging beginners to contribute
Hacktoberfest is all about helping people who are new to open source get comfortable with the process. Here are some ways to start:

* Fix typos in ReadMes
* Improve outdated documentation
* Search open issues on GitHub

#### Use issue labels
