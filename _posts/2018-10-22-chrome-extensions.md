## Right Click Opens Link New Tab Correct Order

Eliminate a step from "Open Link in New Tab" and use your right-click button alone to open new tabs. Now right-clicking a link wil open the link in a new tab in the background with just one-click. This is super helpful for quickly Googling and opening multiple Stack Overflow results.

## Tab Resize

Line up two tabs (or more) side-by-side when you need to have access to mulitple pages at once. This can solve the problem of needing to switch back and forth between multiple tabs.
